 <p>
    I am a PhD student in the GRASP Lab at University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), where I work under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.georgejpappas.org/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none; color:#44BDE2;">George J. Pappas</a>. My research interests lie in the intersection of learning, dynamics and control.
 </p>
 <p> Before joining UPenn, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the Control Systems Laboratory at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), where I was advised by Professor <a href="http://www.controlsystemslab.gr/kkyria/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none; color:#44BDE2;">Kostas J. Kyriakopoulos</a>. I received my diploma (MEng, five-year degree) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from NTUA.
 </p>

<!-- <p>
 Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate at the University of Maryland, College Park, within the Department of Computer Science, working with <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/" target="_blank">Jonathan Katz</a>. My research focused on (i) privacy-preserving strategies for data processing with applications in cyber-physical systems, (ii) multi-party computation and distributed cryptographic protocols under various threat models and network assumptions.
 </p>

  <h3 class="w3-text-black">Education</h4>
 <p></p>
 <p>
    I obtained my PhD in Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in May 2021 under the supervision of professor <a href="https://www.georgejpappas.org/" target="_blank">George J. Pappas</a> (UPenn). In my first year, I was also co-advised by professor <a href="https://jadbabaie.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Ali Jadbabaie</a> (MIT). My thesis committee members were <a href="https://old.control.ee.ethz.ch/info/people/morari/" target="_blank">Manfred Morari</a> (ETHZ and UPenn), <a href="https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/tal-rabin/" target="_blank">Tal Rabin</a> (Algorand and UPenn), and <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sga001/" target="_blank">Sebastian Angel</a> (UPenn).

 </p>

  <p> I have received my B.Eng. in Systems Engineering from University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania, in the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, where I was valedictorian.
